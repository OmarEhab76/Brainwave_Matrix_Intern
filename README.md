# üìä Superstore Sales Analysis

## üß† Internship Project @ Brainwave Matrix Solutions

This project was part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**, where I explored the *Sample Superstore* dataset to uncover business insights and visual analytics for a retail giant. The goal was to understand **what drives profit**, **what products hurt the business**, and **which segments, regions, or categories should be focused on or avoided**.

## üìÅ About the Dataset

**Context:**
With increasing market competition, a Superstore is looking to make data-informed decisions. This dataset helps explore patterns in product sales, regional performance, customer segments, and profitability. It also allows for predictive modeling (e.g., regression for sales/profit).
